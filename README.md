# CABG Surgery Analysis üè•üìä

## Project Description
This healthcare analytics project focused on coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries across the United States. The analysis examined:
- **State-wise hospital distributions** performing CABG surgeries.
- **Mortality rates** associated with surgeries.
- **Correlation between surgery volumes and outcomes**.

The Tableau dashboards provided actionable insights into hospital performance, helping stakeholders identify trends in patient outcomes and operational efficiency.
